Plotting Data
=============

Data in PyMoDAQ are featured with a lot of metadata, allowing their
proper description and enabling seamlessly saving/loading to hdf5 files.
But what about representation? Analysis? Exploration?

With Python you usually do this by writing a script and manipulate and
plot your data using your favorite backend (matplotlib, plotly, qt,
tkinter, â€¦) However because PyMoDAQ is highly graphical you won't need
that. PyMoDAQ is featured with various data viewers allowing you to plot
any kind of data. You'll see below some nice examples of how to plot
your PyMoDAQ's data using the builtin data viewers.
